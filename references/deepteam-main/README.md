**DeepTeam** is a simple-to-use, open-source red teaming framework for LLM systems. Think of it as penetration testing, but for LLMs.

DeepTeam simulates attacks — jailbreaking, prompt injection, multi-turn exploitation, and more — to uncover vulnerabilities like bias, PII leakage, and SQL injection in your AI agents, RAG pipelines, and chatbots. It also offers **guardrails** to prevent these issues in production.

DeepTeam runs **locally on your machine** and is built on [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval), the open-source LLM evaluation framework.

- 🏛️ Red team against established [AI safety frameworks](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/guidelines-and-frameworks) out-of-the-box. Each framework automatically maps its categories to the right vulnerabilities and attacks:
  - OWASP Top 10 for LLMs 2025
  - OWASP Top 10 for Agents 2026
  - NIST AI RMF
  - MITRE ATLAS
  - BeaverTails
  - Aegis
- 🛡️ 7 production-ready [guardrails](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/guardrails) for fast binary classification to guard LLM inputs and outputs in real time.
- 🧩 Build your own **custom vulnerabilities** and attacks that integrate seamlessly with DeepTeam's ecosystem.
- 🔗 Run red teaming from the **CLI** with YAML configs, or programmatically in Python.
- 📊 Access risk assessments, display in dataframes, and save locally in JSON.

&nbsp;

# 🚀 QuickStart

DeepTeam does not require you to define what LLM system you are red teaming — because neither will malicious users. All you need to do is install `deepteam`, define a `model_callback`, and you're good to go.

## Installation

```
pip install -U deepteam
```

## Red Team Your First LLM

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import PromptInjection

async def model_callback(input: str) -> str:
    # Replace this with your LLM application
    return f"I'm sorry but I can't answer this: {input}"

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=model_callback,
    vulnerabilities=[Bias(types=["race"])],
    attacks=[PromptInjection()]
)
```

Don't forget to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable before running (you can also use [any custom model](https://deepeval.com/guides/guides-using-custom-llms) supported in DeepEval), and run the file:

```bash
python red_team_llm.py
```

**That's it! Your first red team is complete.** Here's what happened:

- `model_callback` wraps your LLM system and generates a `str` output for a given `input`.
- At red teaming time, `deepteam` simulates a [`PromptInjection`](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/red-teaming-adversarial-attacks-prompt-injection) attack targeting [`Bias`](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-bias) vulnerabilities.
- Your `model_callback`'s outputs are evaluated using the `BiasMetric`, producing a binary score of 0 or 1.
- The final passing rate for `Bias` is determined by the proportion of scores that equal 1.

Unlike traditional evaluation, red teaming does not require a prepared dataset — adversarial attacks are dynamically generated based on the vulnerabilities you want to test for.

&nbsp;

## Red Team Against Safety Frameworks

Use established AI safety standards like OWASP and NIST instead of manually picking vulnerabilities:

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.frameworks import OWASPTop10

async def model_callback(input: str) -> str:
    # Replace this with your LLM application
    return f"I'm sorry but I can't answer this: {input}"

risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=model_callback,
    framework=OWASPTop10()
)
```

This automatically maps the framework's categories to the right vulnerabilities and attacks. Available frameworks include `OWASPTop10`, `OWASP_ASI_2026`, `NIST`, `MITRE`, `Aegis`, and `BeaverTails`.

&nbsp;

## Guard Your LLM in Production

Once you've found your vulnerabilities, use DeepTeam's guardrails to prevent them in production:

```python
from deepteam import Guardrails
from deepteam.guardrails import PromptInjectionGuard, ToxicityGuard, PrivacyGuard

guardrails = Guardrails(
    input_guards=[PromptInjectionGuard(), PrivacyGuard()],
    output_guards=[ToxicityGuard()]
)

# Guard inputs before they reach your LLM
input_result = guardrails.guard_input("Tell me how to hack a database")
print(input_result.breached)  # True

# Guard outputs before they reach your users
output_result = guardrails.guard_output(input="Hi", output="Here is some toxic content...")
print(output_result.breached)  # True
```

7 guards are available out-of-the-box: `ToxicityGuard`, `PromptInjectionGuard`, `PrivacyGuard`, `IllegalGuard`, `HallucinationGuard`, `TopicalGuard`, and `CybersecurityGuard`. [Read the full guardrails docs here.](https://www.trydeepteam.com/docs/guardrails)
