        text: The text to analyze.
        server_endpoint: The API endpoint URL.
        api_key: The API key for the Polygraf service.
        http_client: Optional shared HTTP client. Passing a client lets callers
            reuse connections across multiple PII checks.
        timeout: Per-request timeout in seconds. Applied to both caller-provided
            and internally created sessions.

    Returns:
        The list of entities detected by the Polygraf server.
