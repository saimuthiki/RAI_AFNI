"""The engine-neutral outcome of a single rail check.

``RailOutcome`` is the canonical, backend-agnostic verdict a rail produces. It
carries only the DECISION and neutral evidence, never how a consequence is
rendered: which exception to raise, which bot intent or refusal message to
emit, and how to localize it are presentation concerns that each engine (the
Colang flow, IORails) decides for itself from this outcome plus its config.

Fields:
- ``decision``: ALLOW / BLOCK / TRANSFORM.
- ``reason``: optional neutral, human-readable explanation.
- ``metadata``: neutral evidence the decision is based on (policy violations,
  categories, scores, or backend-specific details). The top-level mapping is
  copied at construction and is never load-bearing for the decision itself.
  Serialization and disclosure are concerns for consumers at their boundaries.
- ``transforms``: for TRANSFORM, which conversation variables are rewritten
  and to what. Transform outcomes are non-streaming; streaming output paths
  treat the check as non-blocking and do not apply the rewrite.

Deliberately NOT here (they are rendering, not decision): exception type,
refusal intent/message, language, and Colang event/context-update channels.
A BLOCK always means "stop"; there is no soft-block flag.
