"""The engine's fail-closed error envelope, shared by every IORails rail.

A rail that fails blocks, with a redacted reason, so a rail bug cannot let content through.
A failure carrying an upstream HTTP status propagates instead, so a provider outage reaches
the client as the provider's status rather than as a guardrail decision — the two mean very
different things to a caller, and only one is worth retrying.

The policy is the engine's, not any individual rail's, which is why it lives here rather
than in a base class. Every rail calls it from its own ``except`` handler.
