"""Tool-call safety rail for IORails.

Validates the tool calls a model emitted against the request's declared
``Toolset``: every call must name an allowed tool, and its arguments must
satisfy that tool's JSON Schema. The rail is local and model-free -- it runs
through :meth:`ToolRailAction._guarded`, so a malformed call or an unexpected
error fails closed (blocks) rather than propagating.
