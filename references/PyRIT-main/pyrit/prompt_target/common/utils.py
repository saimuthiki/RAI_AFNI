    Record provider-reported, response-level metadata on the first response piece.

    ``prompt_metadata`` is caller-controlled, and ``construct_response_from_request`` merges the
    request's entries into every response piece, so a caller-supplied value could otherwise be
    mistaken for the provider's. ``RESERVED_RESPONSE_METADATA_KEYS`` are therefore reserved for the
    provider: all of them are cleared from every piece first, then the reported ones are set on the
    first piece. Clearing the whole set in one pass — rather than one key per call — is what makes
    the reservation hold, since a target only writes the subset its own API reports. Response-level
    metadata lives on the first piece, matching where ``capture_token_usage`` writes token counts.

    There is one keyword parameter per reserved key so the two cannot drift apart: a key the
    clearing loop does not know about is a type error rather than a value that is silently
    persisted. ``prompt_metadata`` is persisted as JSON, so anything that is not a non-empty
