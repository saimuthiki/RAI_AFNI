    * **TargetCapabilities** — declarative, immutable description of what the
      target natively supports.
    * **CapabilityHandlingPolicy** — per-capability behavior (ADAPT or RAISE)
      when a capability is missing.
    * **ConversationNormalizationPipeline** — ordered sequence of normalizers
      built from the gap between capabilities and policy.

    Each target defines defaults; callers can override policy or individual
    normalizers at creation time.
