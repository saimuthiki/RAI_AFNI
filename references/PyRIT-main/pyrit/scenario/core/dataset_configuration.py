"""
Dataset configuration for scenarios.

``DatasetConfiguration`` is the object a scenario uses to say "where do my seeds come
from." ``DatasetAttackConfiguration`` -- the configuration most scenarios use -- groups
the resolved seeds into ``AttackSeedGroup`` s (each carrying exactly one objective plus
optional prompts).

Constraints are expressed through a single mechanism: ``validators``. Each validator is a
``Callable[[ResolvedDataset], None]`` that raises ``DatasetConstraintError`` on violation.
Validators run against the fully resolved dataset (before ``max_dataset_size`` sampling),
so they describe the dataset itself, not the sampled subset. The ``ResolvedDataset`` they
receive also carries the ``DatasetSourceKind`` (inline vs from memory) and the contributing
``dataset_names``, which lets a scenario require or forbid inline seeds -- useful for CLI
flags such as ``--objectives`` -- restrict which datasets it will resolve from, or require a
particular seed type (e.g. ``require_seed_type(SeedObjective)``).

Memory is the source of truth. When a configured dataset name is not yet in memory and
``auto_fetch`` is enabled (the default), the resolver transparently fetches the dataset
from the registered ``SeedDatasetProvider`` into memory. If a configured dataset
name still yields nothing, the resolver raises loudly rather than silently skipping it.
Inline configs (``seeds=`` / ``seed_groups=``) never touch memory.
