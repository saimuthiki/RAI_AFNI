    """
    Base class for attack techniques with tag-based categorization and aggregation.

    This class provides a pattern for defining attack techniques as enums where each
    technique has a set of tags for flexible categorization. It supports aggregate tags
    (like "easy", "moderate", "difficult" or "fast", "medium") that automatically expand
    to include all techniques with that tag.

    **Convention**: Technique enum members should map 1:1 to selectable **attack techniques**
    (e.g., ``PromptSending``, ``RolePlay``, ``TAP``) or to aggregates of techniques
    (e.g., ``DEFAULT``, ``SINGLE_TURN``).  Datasets control *what* content or objectives
    are tested; techniques control *how* attacks are executed.  Avoid encoding dataset or
    category selection into the technique enum — use ``DatasetConfiguration`` and the
    ``--dataset-names`` CLI flag for that axis.

    **Tags**: Flexible categorization system where techniques can have multiple tags
    (e.g., {"easy", "converter"}, {"difficult", "multi_turn"})

    Subclasses should define their enum members with (value, tags) tuples and
    override the get_aggregate_tags() classmethod to specify which tags
    represent aggregates that should expand.

    **Convention**: All subclasses should include `ALL = ("all", {"all"})` as the first
    aggregate member. The base class automatically handles expanding "all" to
    include all non-aggregate techniques.

    The normalization process automatically:
    1. Expands aggregate tags into their constituent techniques
    2. Excludes the aggregate tag enum members themselves from the final set
    3. Handles the special "all" tag by expanding to all non-aggregate techniques
