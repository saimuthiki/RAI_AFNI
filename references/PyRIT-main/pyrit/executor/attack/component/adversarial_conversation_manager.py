class _AdversarialConversationManager:
    """
    Drives a single adversarial-chat conversation for a multi-turn attack.

    One manager owns one adversarial conversation (identified by ``conversation_id``): the
    conversation id is what preserves the adversarial chat's own running history across turns.
    Crescendo, TAP, PAIR, and Red Teaming would otherwise each hand-roll the recurring
    mechanics this component centralizes and owns end to end:

    1. Holding the resolved adversarial system prompt, the (optional) first user message, the
       per-turn next-message template, and the single response JSON schema — defaulting to the
       canonical ``adversarial_chat`` schema when no prompt declares one, so a reply is always
       structurally validated instead of silently trusted.
    2. Setting the adversarial system prompt on the conversation (rendered with ``objective`` and
       ``max_turns``) via ``set_adversarial_system_prompt``.
    3. Building per-turn prompt metadata — ``response_format`` plus the shared schema — so
       schema-aware targets natively constrain the response shape.
    4. Sending the turn to the adversarial target on this manager's ``conversation_id`` and parsing
       the shared ``adversarial_chat`` schema (``next_message`` / ``rationale`` /
       ``last_response_summary``) out of the reply, retrying on invalid JSON.
    5. Building the ready-to-send objective ``Message`` from the reply — weaving in prior-response or
       seed media via the modality router, filling adversarial placeholders, or bypassing the
       adversarial chat entirely when the caller supplies a concrete seed message.

    Conversation context (``conversation_id``, ``objective``, ``max_turns``, the objective target's
    conversation id, the attack strategy name, and memory labels) is supplied once at construction
    time and reused for every turn. Most attacks call the single entry point ``get_next_message_async``
    and receive an ``AdversarialTurn`` whose ``objective_message`` is ready to send — they never
    branch on adversarial placeholders, hand-roll feedback text, or build the objective message
    themselves. Attacks that must inspect the parsed reply *before* deciding what to send (e.g. TAP,
    which scores ``next_message`` for on-topic-ness and may re-prompt with feedback) call
    ``generate_adversarial_reply_async`` for the send/parse half and build the objective message
    themselves.

    Two modes share the same send/parse/schema/modality core:

    * **Template mode** (Red Teaming): the manager computes the per-turn feedback text in Python
      (handling blocked/error/empty responses and optional score feedback) and renders it into the
      first-message / next-message templates.
    * **Override mode** (Crescendo, TAP): the attack supplies the fully-built adversarial prompt text
      via ``adversarial_prompt_text`` (or ``prompt_text``) and the manager does everything else.
