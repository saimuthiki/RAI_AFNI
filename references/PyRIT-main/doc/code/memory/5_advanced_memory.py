# # Memory Labels and Advanced Memory Queries
#
# This notebook covers two ways to filter and retrieve data from PyRIT's memory:
#
# 1. **Memory Labels** — free-form key/value tags attached to every prompt, useful for grouping and retrieval.
# 2. **Identifier Filters** — structured filters that match against the JSON-backed identifier columns
#    (target, converter, scorer, attack) stored alongside different memory entities, such as `MessagePiece`, `AttackResult`, etc.
#    This notebook demonstrates the functionality with `MessagePiece` entities, but the concepts are similar for other memory entities.
# 3. **Score Identifier Filters** — the same `IdentifierFilter` mechanism applied to `memory.get_scores()` for
#    retrieving scores by scorer identity (class name, custom parameters, etc.).
#
# ## Part 1 — Memory Labels
#
# Memory labels are a free-form dictionary for tagging prompts for easier querying and scoring later on. The `GLOBAL_MEMORY_LABELS`
# environment variable can be set to apply labels (e.g. `operator` and `operation`) to all prompts sent by any attack.
# Passed-in labels will be combined with `GLOBAL_MEMORY_LABELS` into one dictionary. In the case of collisions,
# the passed-in labels take precedence.
#
# You can then query the database (either AzureSQL or SQLite) for prompts with specific labels, such as `operator` and/or `operation`
# (which are standard), as well as any others you'd like, including `harm_category`, `language`, `technique`, etc.
#
# We take the following steps in Part 1:
# 1. Send prompts to a text target using `PromptSendingAttack`, passing in `memory_labels` to the execution function.
# 2. Retrieve these prompts by querying for the corresponding memory label(s).
# 3. Resend the retrieved prompts.

# ## Part 2 — Identifier Filters
#
# Every `MessagePiece` stored in memory carries JSON identifier columns for the **target**, **converter(s)**, and
# **attack** that produced it. `IdentifierFilter` lets you query against these columns without writing raw SQL.
#
# An `IdentifierFilter` has the following fields:
#
# | Field | Description |
# |---|---|
# | `identifier_type` | Which identifier column to search — `TARGET`, `CONVERTER`, `ATTACK`, or `SCORER`. |
# | `property_path` | A JSON path such as `$.class_name`, `$.endpoint`, `$.model_name`, etc. |
# | `value` | The value to match. |
# | `partial_match` | If `True`, performs a substring (LIKE) match. |
# | `array_element_path` | For array columns (e.g. converter_identifiers), the JSON path within each element. |
#
# The examples below query against data already in memory from Part 1.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Filter by target class name
#
# In Part 1 we sent prompts to both an `OpenAIChatTarget` and a `TextTarget`.
# We can retrieve only the prompts that were sent to a specific target.

# %%

filter_target_classes = ["OpenAIChatTarget", "TextTarget"]

for filter_target_class in filter_target_classes:
    # Get only the prompts that were sent to a specific target
    target_class_filter = IdentifierFilter(
        identifier_type=IdentifierType.TARGET,
        property_path="$.class_name",
        value=filter_target_class,

    for piece in target_class_pieces:
        print(f"  [{piece.api_role}] {piece.converted_value[:80]}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Filter by target with partial match
#
# You don't need an exact match — `partial_match=True` performs a substring search.
# This is handy when you know part of a class name, endpoint URL, or model name.

# %%
# Find all pieces sent to any target whose class_name contains "OpenAI"
openai_filter = IdentifierFilter(
    identifier_type=IdentifierType.TARGET,
    property_path="$.class_name",
    value="OpenAI",
    partial_match=True,
)

openai_pieces = memory.get_message_pieces(

print(f"Message pieces to/from *OpenAI* targets: {len(openai_pieces)}")
for piece in openai_pieces:
    print(f"  [{piece.api_role}] {piece.original_value[:80]}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Filter by converter (array column)
#
# Converter identifiers are stored as a JSON **array** (since a prompt can pass through multiple converters).
# Use `array_element_path` to match if *any* converter in the list satisfies the condition.

# %%
# Find all message pieces that were processed by a Base64Converter
converter_filter = IdentifierFilter(
    identifier_type=IdentifierType.CONVERTER,
    property_path="$",
    array_element_path="$.class_name",
    value="Base64Converter",
)

base64_pieces = memory.get_message_pieces(

for piece in base64_pieces:
    print(f"  [{piece.api_role}] original: {piece.original_value[:60]} → converted: {piece.converted_value[:60]}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Combining multiple filters
#
# You can pass several `IdentifierFilter` objects at once; all filters are AND-ed together.
# Here we find prompts that were sent to a `TextTarget` **and** used a `Base64Converter`.

# %%
text_target_filter = IdentifierFilter(
    identifier_type=IdentifierType.TARGET,
    property_path="$.class_name",

print(f"Pieces to/from TextTarget AND using Base64Converter: {len(combined_pieces)}")
for piece in combined_pieces:
    print(f"  [{piece.api_role}] {piece.original_value[:80]}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Mixing labels and identifier filters
#
# Labels and identifier filters can be used together. Labels narrow by your custom tags,
# while identifier filters narrow by the infrastructure (target, converter, etc.) that
# handled each prompt.

# %%
# Retrieve prompts from our labeled group that specifically went through Base64Converter
labeled_and_filtered = memory.get_message_pieces(
    labels={"prompt_group": group1},
    identifier_filters=[converter_filter],
)

print(f"Labeled + filtered pieces: {len(labeled_and_filtered)}")
for piece in labeled_and_filtered:
    print(f"  [{piece.api_role}] {piece.original_value[:80]}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 3 — Filtering Scores by Scorer Identity
#
# `IdentifierFilter` also works with `memory.get_scores()`. Every `Score` stored in memory records the
# **scorer's identifier** — a JSON object that contains the class name as well as any custom parameters
# the scorer was initialized with.
#
# In this example we create two `SubStringScorer` instances with different substrings, score the
# assistant responses from Part 1, and then use `identifier_filters` on `memory.get_scores()` to
# retrieve only the scores produced by a specific scorer.

# %%
from pyrit.models import Message
from pyrit.score import SubStringScorer

# Create three scorers with different substrings
scorer_molotov = SubStringScorer(substring="molotov")
scorer_launder = SubStringScorer(substring="launder")
scorer_assist = SubStringScorer(
    substring="assist"
)  # intentionally bad scorer that matches when the phrase 'assist' is present in response. But good for demo.

# Retrieve assistant responses from Part 1
assistant_pieces = memory.get_message_pieces(
    labels={"prompt_group": group1},
    role="assistant",
)

# Wrap each piece in a Message so we can pass it to score_async
assistant_messages = [Message(message_pieces=[piece]) for piece in assistant_pieces]

# Score every response with both scorers — scores are automatically persisted in memory
for msg in assistant_messages:
    await scorer_molotov.score_async(msg)  # type: ignore
    await scorer_launder.score_async(msg)  # type: ignore
    await scorer_assist.score_async(msg)  # type: ignore

print(f"Scored {len(assistant_messages)} messages with all three scorers.")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Filter scores by scorer class name
#
# The simplest filter retrieves all scores produced by a particular scorer class.

# %%
# Retrieve all SubStringScorer scores regardless of which substring was used
scorer_class_filter = IdentifierFilter(
    identifier_type=IdentifierType.SCORER,
    property_path="$.class_name",
    value="SubStringScorer",
)

all_substring_scores = memory.get_scores(
    identifier_filters=[scorer_class_filter],
)

print(f"Total SubStringScorer scores in memory: {len(all_substring_scores)}")
for s in all_substring_scores:
    print(f" score={s.get_value()}  category={s.score_category}")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Filter scores by custom scorer parameter
#
# Scorer identifiers store custom parameters alongside the class name. For `SubStringScorer`, the
# identifier includes a `substring` property. We can filter on it to retrieve only the scores
# produced by the scorer configured with a particular substring.

# %%
# Retrieve only scores from the scorer whose substring was "molotov"
molotov_scorer_filter = IdentifierFilter(
    identifier_type=IdentifierType.SCORER,
    property_path="$.substring",
    value="molotov",
)

molotov_scores = memory.get_scores(
    identifier_filters=[molotov_scorer_filter],
)

print(f"Scores from the 'molotov' SubStringScorer: {len(molotov_scores)}")
for s in molotov_scores:
    print(f"  score={s.get_value()}  category={s.score_category}")

print()

# Now retrieve only scores from the scorer whose substring was "launder"
launder_scorer_filter = IdentifierFilter(
    identifier_type=IdentifierType.SCORER,
    property_path="$.substring",
    value="launder",
)

launder_scores = memory.get_scores(
    identifier_filters=[launder_scorer_filter],
)

print(f"Scores from the 'launder' SubStringScorer: {len(launder_scores)}")

    print(f"  score={s.get_value()}  category={s.score_category}")

print()

# Now retrieve only scores from the scorer whose substring was "assist"
assist_scorer_filter = IdentifierFilter(
    identifier_type=IdentifierType.SCORER,
    property_path="$.substring",
    value="assist",
)

assist_scores = memory.get_scores(
    identifier_filters=[assist_scorer_filter],
)
