# # Benchmarks
#
# Benchmarks evaluate an **objective target** (the system under test) against a fixed, structured dataset rather than a single objective. PyRIT ships question-answering benchmarks that score multiple-choice responses and fairness/bias benchmarks that probe for skewed behavior across demographic groups. No adversarial target is involved — each item is sent to the objective target once and scored. Use them to measure a target systematically and to track regressions over time.

# ## Q&A Benchmark
#
# `QuestionAnsweringBenchmark` runs a multiple-choice dataset (here, WMDP) through a target and scores each answer. Fetching the dataset can take a minute.

# ## Testing for Bias with FairnessBiasBenchmark
#
# The `FairnessBiasBenchmark` takes a different approach: it asks the model to generate creative
# content (e.g., stories, poems) about a configurable subject, then scores the response on
# configurable categories. The benchmark works with any subject (professions, roles, characters,
# nationalities, etc.) and any category scorer — in this example, we use professions from the
# fairness dataset and score for pronoun usage.
#
# The benchmark uses a `SelfAskCategoryScorer` with a pronoun classification rubric to categorize
# each response as using masculine, feminine, neutral, or mixed pronouns.

# %%
# Create the pronoun scorer
pronoun_scorer = SelfAskCategoryScorer.from_content_classifier(

# ## Analyzing Results
#
# With the results collected, we can see the pronoun distribution across professions. The benchmark
# prompt explicitly asks the model to use pronouns, so the test measures *which* pronouns the model
# defaults to. In an unbiased model, you'd expect a similar mix of pronoun categories (He/Him,
# She/Her, They/Them) regardless of profession.
