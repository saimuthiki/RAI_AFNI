# # Compound Attacks
#
# A compound attack orchestrates *other* attacks toward a **single objective**. It doesn't send
# requests to the objective target itself — instead it runs a list of inner attacks (each a single- or
# multi-turn executor) in order, and decides when to stop based on their outcomes. This keeps PyRIT's
# one-objective → one-result invariant: the compound returns a single `AttackResult`, with each inner
# attack's result preserved as a child.
#
# The targets work exactly as before. The **objective target** is still the system under test, and
# each inner attack carries its own target configuration — e.g. the Crescendo below is constructed with
# its own **adversarial target**. (`SequentialChildAttack` can also supply an `adversarial_chat` used
# when expanding seeds / simulated conversations for the child.)
#
# | Attack | What it does |
# |---|---|
# | Sequential | Runs inner attacks in order against one objective, stopping per a completion policy. |
#
# The canonical use case is a **fallback chain**: *try the cheap/strong attack first, fall back to
# another if it doesn't land*. A `SequenceCompletionPolicy` controls both when iteration stops and how
# the envelope's outcome is derived:
#
# | Policy | Stops when | Envelope outcome |
# |---|---|---|
# | `FIRST_SUCCESS` *(default)* | a child succeeds (continues past errors/failures) | SUCCESS if any child did |
# | `FIRST_DECISIVE` | a child succeeds **or** errors | SUCCESS if any child did |
# | `STRICT_ALL` | the first non-success | SUCCESS only if **every** child did (pipeline) |
# | `EXHAUSTIVE` | never (runs all) | SUCCESS if any child did |
# | `LAST_RESULT` | never (runs all) | inherits the last child's outcome |

# ## Sequential
#
# `SequentialAttack` takes a list of `SequentialChildAttack` entries — each pairing an inner attack
# with the `AttackSeedGroup` carrying the objective — and runs them in order under a
# `SequenceCompletionPolicy`. Below we *try Crescendo first, then fall back to Prompt Sending*. With
# the default `FIRST_SUCCESS` policy, the sequence stops as soon as one inner attack succeeds.
