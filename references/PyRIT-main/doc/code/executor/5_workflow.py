# # Workflows
#
# Workflows orchestrate attacks that involve more than a single target exchange — they wire together an *attack setup* step, an external *processing* step, and scoring. The canonical example is a **Cross-domain Prompt Injection Attack (XPIA)**, where an adversary plants instructions in content (a web page, a resume, an email) that a separate AI system later ingests and acts on.
#
# Unlike the single- and multi-turn attacks, the attacker here never talks to the **objective target** (the AI system that later ingests the content) directly; the injection is delivered through a side channel and triggered by a legitimate user (or agent) action. This page shows two `XPIAWorkflow` examples.
#
# > These notebooks require external infrastructure (Azure Blob Storage, a running AI-recruiter Docker service). The outputs below are preserved from a prior run.
#
# The results and intermediate interactions are saved to memory according to your environment settings; see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../memory/0_memory.md).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Website XPIA
#
# The attacker uploads an HTML file containing a jailbreak prompt to an Azure Blob Storage container. A summarization agent later fetches that page, and the entire flow is handled by `XPIAWorkflow`. The model may still resist depending on its metaprompt and content filters.

# _Note:_ to run this section of the demo you need to setup your `.env` file to properly authenticate to an Azure Storage Blob Container and an Azure OpenAI target.
# See the section within [.env_example](https://github.com/microsoft/PyRIT/blob/main/.env_example) if not sure where to find values for each of these variables.
#
# Below, we define a simple agent using OpenAI's responses API to retrieve content from websites.
# This is to simulate a processing target similar to what one might expect in an XPIA-oriented AI red teaming operation.

# ## AI Recruiter (RAG) XPIA
#
# This example targets a Retrieval-Augmented Generation hiring screener. A candidate hides "relevant skills" text inside a resume PDF; the `XPIATestWorkflow` uploads it and triggers a candidate search, causing the under-qualified applicant to rank near the top. It demonstrates why RAG systems need robust input validation.
