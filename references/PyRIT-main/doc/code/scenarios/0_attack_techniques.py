# # Attack Techniques
#
# An **attack technique** is *anything that, once configured, generally helps an attack achieve its
# objective* — a role-play framing, a many-shot priming set, a particular jailbreak template, a
# crescendo escalation. A technique is always **specific to an attack**: it is the *how* of one
# configured [attack](../executor/0_executor.md) (the algorithm — e.g. `PromptSendingAttack`,
# `TreeOfAttacksWithPruningAttack`), bundled with the seeds and configuration that make it a reusable
# recipe and packaged so a scenario can pick it by name. The objective — the *what* you are probing
# for — stays separate and is supplied by the dataset.
#
# > **Technique vs. attack.** The *attack* (a.k.a. executor) is the algorithm that runs prompts
# > against a target. The *technique* wraps one configured attack so it can be registered, listed,
# > tagged, and selected without the caller knowing how it is built. A [Scenario](./0_scenarios.ipynb)
# > runs a set of techniques against a set of objectives.
#
# A technique is represented by
# [`AttackTechnique`](../../../pyrit/scenario/core/attack_technique.py) and built by an
# [`AttackTechniqueFactory`](../../../pyrit/scenario/core/attack_technique_factory.py). Concretely, in
# PyRIT terms, a technique can bundle:
#
# - the **attack class** (`attack_class`, an `AttackStrategy` subclass) **and all its constructor
#   args** (`attack_kwargs`) — e.g. `max_turns`, `tree_width`/`tree_depth`, or an
#   `AttackConverterConfig` of request/response **converters**;
# - an **adversarial chat** target (`adversarial_chat`) plus its **system prompt**
#   (`adversarial_system_prompt_path`) and **seed prompt** (`adversarial_seed_prompt`), for attacks
#   that drive a conversation;
# - a **`AttackTechniqueSeedGroup`** (`seed_technique`) of general-technique seeds, which can carry a
#   **system prompt**, a **prepended_conversation**, a **simulated_conversation**
#   (`SeedSimulatedConversation`), and a **next_message**;
# - the selection metadata that lets a scenario pick it: its `name` and `technique_tags`.
#
# The objective is *not* part of the technique — it stays separate and is supplied by the dataset at
# run time. You rarely build a technique by hand; instead you register a **factory** and let scenarios
# construct techniques on demand with the scenario's own objective target and scorer.

# ## Where techniques come from: initializers
#
# The technique catalog lives under
# [`pyrit/setup/initializers/techniques/`](../../../pyrit/setup/initializers/techniques/technique_initializer.py).
# Techniques
# are grouped into small **group modules**, each of which exposes a `get_technique_factories()`
# function returning a list of
# [`AttackTechniqueFactory`](../../../pyrit/scenario/core/attack_technique_factory.py) instances:
#
# - [`core.py`](../../../pyrit/setup/initializers/techniques/core.py) — the general-purpose techniques
#   any scenario can use (the `role_play_*` variants, `many_shot`, `tap`, the `crescendo_*` variants, `red_teaming`,
#   `context_compliance`). Registered by default.
# - [`extra.py`](../../../pyrit/setup/initializers/techniques/extra.py) — opt-in techniques that are
#   not part of the default set (`pair`, `violent_durian`, `skeleton_key`).
# - [`airt.py`](../../../pyrit/setup/initializers/techniques/airt.py) — source-owned techniques that
#   belong to a specific AIRT scenario. Unlike `core`/`extra`, these are imported directly by their
#   owning scenario and are *not* part of the default aggregation.
#
# [`TechniqueInitializer`](../../../pyrit/setup/initializers/techniques/technique_initializer.py) is
# the initializer that aggregates the selected group modules and registers their factories into the
# singleton
# [`AttackTechniqueRegistry`](../../../pyrit/registry/components/attack_technique_registry.py). As it
# aggregates, it injects each group's name as a technique tag (every `core` technique gains the `core`
# tag, every `extra` technique gains `extra`), so a whole group is selectable at once. Each factory is
# self-describing — it knows its `name`, the attack class it builds, its tags, and whether it needs an
# adversarial chat target — so a scenario can construct the technique lazily with the scenario's own
# objective target and scorer.
#
# Which groups get registered is controlled by the initializer's `tags` parameter (set via
# `set_params_from_args`, the same path `pyrit_scan`/`initialize_pyrit_async` use to pass YAML args):
#
# - default (no `tags`) — registers **`core`** only.
# - `tags=["core", "extra"]` — registers both groups.
# - `tags=["all"]` — shorthand for `core` + `extra`.
#
# Registration is per-name idempotent, so initializers compose: run more than one and each adds only
# the techniques that aren't already registered.
#
# The cell below registers every group (`tags=["all"]`) and lists the full catalog.

# ## Executing a single technique
#
# Scenarios normally build and run techniques for you, but because a factory is self-describing you
# can also pull one straight from the registry and run it yourself. This is the smallest end-to-end
# path: take a registered factory, `create()` a concrete `AttackTechnique` bound to your target and
# scorer, wrap it with the objective in an
# [`AtomicAttack`](../../../pyrit/scenario/core/atomic_attack.py), and call `run_async()`.
#
# An `AtomicAttack` pairs one configured technique (the *how*) with one or more
# [`AttackSeedGroup`](../../../pyrit/models/seeds/attack_seed_group.py)s that each carry an objective
# (the *what*). It runs the technique against every objective and returns the results — the same unit
# a `Scenario` executes internally, minus the orchestration.
#
# Below we grab the `role_play_movie_script` factory registered above, bind it to an `OpenAIChatTarget`,
# and run it against a single objective.

# ## How techniques are selected
#
# Scenarios don't reference factories directly. Instead, a scenario's
# [`ScenarioTechnique`](../../../pyrit/scenario/core/scenario_technique.py) enum is built *from* the
# registered factories: every technique becomes an enum member, and the factory's tags become
# selectable aggregates. That gives you three ways to choose what runs:
#
# - **By name** — pick a single technique (e.g. `role_play_movie_script`).
# - **By aggregate tag** — pick a group that expands to every matching technique. `ALL` is always
#   present; tags like `single_turn`, `multi_turn`, `default`, and `light` come from the factories.
# - **Composite** — pair a technique with converters (see
#   [Common Scenario Parameters](./1_common_scenario_parameters.ipynb)).
#
# On the command line this is the `--technique` flag of
# [`pyrit_scan`](../../scanner/1_pyrit_scan.ipynb); programmatically it's the `scenario_techniques`
# argument to `initialize_async`. The grouping is what lets `--technique single_turn` or
# `--technique light` fan out to a whole family of techniques without naming each one.

# ## Relationship to single-turn attacks
#
# Many single-turn attacks are, in effect, attack techniques: a `PromptSendingAttack` paired with a
# specific set of seeds or a fixed configuration. `crescendo_simulated` and the persona-driven
# crescendo variants in the catalog above are exactly that — a plain `PromptSendingAttack` plus
# different seed groups. When you find yourself reaching for a one-off single-turn attack subclass,
# consider whether it would be better expressed as a registered technique so scenarios can select it
# by name and tag.
#
# ## Defining your own
#
# To add a technique, register a factory. The simplest form names an attack class and tags it:
#
# ```python
# from pyrit.executor.attack import PromptSendingAttack
# from pyrit.registry import AttackTechniqueRegistry
# from pyrit.scenario.core.attack_technique_factory import AttackTechniqueFactory
#
# AttackTechniqueRegistry.get_registry_singleton().register_from_factories(
#     [
#         AttackTechniqueFactory(
#             name="my_prompt_sending",
#             attack_class=PromptSendingAttack,
#             technique_tags=["single_turn", "custom"],
#         )
#     ]
# )
# ```
#
# Wrap registration in a `PyRITInitializer` (as `TechniqueInitializer` does) when you want it
# to run as part of standard setup. Any scenario built afterwards will see `my_prompt_sending` as a
# selectable technique.
#
# To ship a technique as part of the standard catalog, add it to one of the group modules under
# [`pyrit/setup/initializers/techniques/`](../../../pyrit/setup/initializers/techniques/technique_initializer.py)
# instead of
# registering it ad hoc: put general-purpose techniques in `core.py`, opt-in ones in `extra.py`, and
# scenario-owned ones in `airt.py`. Each module's `get_technique_factories()` is picked up by
# `TechniqueInitializer`, which injects the group name as a tag so your technique is selectable both by
# name and as part of its group.
