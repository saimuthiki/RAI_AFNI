# # Azure Blob Storage Targets
#
# Prompt Targets are most often LLMs, but not always. They should be thought of as anything that you send prompts to.
#
#
# The `AzureBlobStorageTarget` inherits from `PromptTarget`, meaning it has functionality to send prompts. Unlike chat-style targets (which declare `supports_multi_turn=True` and `supports_editable_history=True`), this target does not interact with chat assistants.
# This prompt target in particular will take in a prompt and upload it as a text file to the provided Azure Storage Account Container.
# This could be useful for Cross-Prompt Injection Attack scenarios, for example, where there is a jailbreak within a file.
