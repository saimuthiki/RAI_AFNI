# # Simulated Conversations
#
# Multi-turn attacks like Crescendo [@russinovich2024crescendo] are powerful but slow — each turn
# requires a round-trip to the target. If you've already generated a successful multi-turn prefix
# on one model, you can **reuse** that prefix on other models by replaying the conversation history.
#
# The `generate_simulated_conversation_async` utility creates a multi-turn conversation between an
# adversarial LLM and a simulated target (the same LLM playing both roles). The result is a
# `list[SeedPrompt]` that you can wrap in a `SeedGroup` and feed into any multi-turn attack as
# `prepended_conversation`. (Note: system prompts are an alternative way to provide context to
# attacks; `prepended_conversation` is the current API for replaying conversation history.)
#
# **Use cases:**
# - Precompute expensive conversation prefixes once, reuse on slower or newer models
# - Create dynamic role-play scenarios (e.g., movie script, video game) as conversation starters
# - Generate multi-turn jailbreak setups without hardcoded responses
#
# ## Generating a Simulated Conversation
#
# The function takes an objective, an adversarial chat model, a scorer, and a system prompt path.
# It runs a `RedTeamingAttack` internally with the adversarial LLM playing both attacker and target
# roles.

# ## Inspecting the Results
#
# The function returns a `list[SeedPrompt]` with alternating user/assistant messages. Wrapping them
# in a `SeedGroup` gives you convenient access to `prepended_conversation` (all turns except the
# last) and `next_message` (the final user message to continue from, if available).
# Note that `next_message` is only populated when the last generated message has role `"user"` —
# if you need a final user turn, pass `next_message_system_prompt_path` to the function.

# ## Replaying on a Different Target
#
# Now that we have a conversation prefix, we can replay it against a different (potentially slower)
# target. The `CrescendoAttack` accepts `prepended_conversation` and `next_message` so the
# conversation continues from where the simulation left off.
#
# Notice in the output below that the first N-1 turns match the simulated conversation, but the
# final turn is a fresh exchange with the new target.

# > **Note:** If the Crescendo result shows `backtrack_count: 0` even on failure, this is expected.
# > Backtracking only triggers when the target **refuses** a prompt, not when the objective score is
# > low. A cooperative but unhelpful response won't trigger a backtrack. Also, prepended turns count
# > against `max_turns`, so increase `max_turns` accordingly to leave room for new exchanges.

# ## Key Parameters
#
# | Parameter | Type | Description |
# |-----------|------|-------------|
# | `objective` | `str` | The goal the adversarial chat works toward |
# | `adversarial_chat` | `PromptTarget` | The LLM that generates attack prompts (also plays the simulated target). Must declare `supports_multi_turn=True` and `supports_editable_history=True`. |
# | `objective_scorer` | `TrueFalseScorer` | Evaluates whether the final turn achieved the objective |
# | `num_turns` | `int` | Number of conversation turns to generate (default: 3) |
# | `adversarial_chat_system_prompt_path` | `str \| Path` | System prompt for the adversarial chat role |
# | `simulated_target_system_prompt_path` | `str \| Path \| None` | Optional system prompt for the simulated target role |
# | `next_message_system_prompt_path` | `str \| Path \| None` | Optional path to generate a final user message that elicits objective fulfillment |
# | `attack_converter_config` | `AttackConverterConfig \| None` | Optional converter configuration for the attack |
# | `memory_labels` | `dict[str, str] \| None` | Labels for tracking in memory |
#
# The function returns a `list[SeedPrompt]` with user/assistant messages. Wrap in `SeedGroup` to
# access `prepended_conversation` and `next_message` for use in downstream attacks.
