# # Scoring
# %% [markdown]
# Scoring evaluates what happened to a prompt. It is how PyRIT answers questions like:
#
# - Was prompt injection detected?
# - Was the prompt blocked? Why?
# - Was there harmful content in the response? How bad was it?
#
# A scorer takes a response (or a whole conversation) and returns one or more
# [`Score`](../../../pyrit/models/score.py) objects. Scorers are used three ways:
# directly (this page), automatically inside an [attack](../executor/1_single_turn.ipynb#prompt-sending),
# and over many stored responses with the [batch scorer](#batch-scoring).
#
# ## The two return types
#
# Every concrete scorer returns one of two score types:
#
# - **`true_false`** — a boolean. Good for success criteria ("did the attack succeed?"),
#   refusal detection, and policy checks. `score.get_value()` returns a `bool`.
# - **`float_scale`** — a number normalized to `0.0`–`1.0`. Good for quantifying *how much*
#   of something is present (e.g. severity of harmful content). `score.get_value()` returns a `float`.
#
# The two are convertible: a `float_scale` score becomes `true_false` by applying a
# threshold (see [Combining & stacking scorers](3_combining_scorers.ipynb)).
# %% [markdown]
# ## Scorer reference table
#
# Every concrete scorer, grouped by return type. The table is generated from
# `get_scorer_info()`, which inspects each scorer class without instantiating it.

# ## The class hierarchy
#
# Every scorer derives from the abstract `Scorer` class through one of three intermediate
# bases: `TrueFalseScorer`, `FloatScaleScorer`, or `ConversationScorer`.

# %% [markdown] class="col-page-right"

# ```mermaid

#     class Scorer { <<abstract>> }
#     class FloatScaleScorer { <<abstract>> }
#     class TrueFalseScorer { <<abstract>> }
#     class ConversationScorer { <<abstract>> }
#
#     Scorer <|-- FloatScaleScorer
#     Scorer <|-- TrueFalseScorer

# ```

# %% [markdown]
#
# `ConversationScorer` is never instantiated directly. `create_conversation_scorer()`
# builds a subclass that mixes it with a `TrueFalseScorer` or `FloatScaleScorer` so the
# wrapped scorer can run over a whole conversation — covered in
# [Combining & stacking scorers](3_combining_scorers.ipynb).
# %% [markdown]
# ## Scoring directly
#
# The smallest example: a local `SubStringScorer` (a `true_false` scorer) over a string.
# No model call, no credentials.
# %%
from pyrit.score import SubStringScorer

scorer = SubStringScorer(substring="I hate", categories=["hate"])

flagged = (await scorer.score_text_async(text="I hate you."))[0]  # type: ignore

print(f"'I hate you.' -> {flagged.get_value()}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Scoring inside an attack
#
# Most of the time a scorer is handed to an attack as the **objective scorer** that decides
# whether the objective was met. Here a `SubStringScorer` and a local `TextTarget` keep the
# example offline. `TextTarget` just records the prompt and returns no assistant content, so
# there is nothing substantive for the scorer to flag — swap in an LLM-backed
# [target](../targets/0_prompt_targets.md) (and any scorer) to score a real model response.

)

result = await attack.execute_async(objective="Say something hateful")  # type: ignore
await output_attack_async(result)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Batch scoring
#
# `BatchScorer` scores responses already in memory — for example everything an attack sent.
# It runs in parallel and can select responses by conversation, prompt id, memory labels,
# timestamps, and more. It works with any scorer; here we reuse the local `SubStringScorer`.
